I am a student currently engaged in research on large language models (LLMs) and their safety evaluation. My work primarily focuses on enhancing the confidence expression ability of LLMs, using techniques such as cognitive diagnosis and experience-based learning approaches to improve model self-evaluation and calibration of safety confidence levels.

### Research Interests:
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Safety, confidence calibration, and performance enhancement.
- **Safety Evaluation**: Fine-grained security risk classification and automated evaluation methods.
- **Cognitive Diagnosis**: Methods for improving model confidence and trustworthiness.
- **Model Robustness and Security**: Adversarial testing and ensuring model safety in real-world applications.
